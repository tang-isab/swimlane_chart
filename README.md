## How to Run

### Option 1: Using Python directly
```bash
python chart.py
```

### Option 2: Using the batch file (Windows)
Double-click `start_server.bat`

## Sharing on Network

When you run the server, it will display:
- **Local access**: `http://localhost:8000` (only on your computer)
- **Network access**: `http://YOUR_IP:8000` (accessible to others on your network)

### For others to access:

1. Make sure they're on the same network (WiFi/LAN)
2. Share the network URL: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`
3. Configure Windows Firewall (see below)

### Quick Firewall Fix:

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
1. Right-click `setup_firewall.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
2. Follow the prompts

**Option 2: Manual PowerShell Command**
Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Swimlane Project Tracker" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8000 -Action Allow
```

**Option 3: GUI Method**
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
2. Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
3. Select "Port" ‚Üí Next
4. Select "TCP" and enter "8000" ‚Üí Next
5. Select "Allow the connection" ‚Üí Next
6. Check all profiles ‚Üí Next
7. Name it "Swimlane Project Tracker" ‚Üí Finish

### Troubleshooting:

**If others still can't access:**
1. **Check your IP**: The server will show all available network URLs when it starts
2. **Test locally first**: Make sure `http://localhost:8000` works
3. **Same network**: Ensure everyone is on the same WiFi/LAN
4. **Firewall**: Try temporarily disabling Windows Firewall to test
5. **Antivirus**: Some antivirus software blocks incoming connections
6. **Router**: Some routers block device-to-device communication

**Common IP addresses to try:**
- If you see multiple IPs when the server starts, try each one
- Usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x
